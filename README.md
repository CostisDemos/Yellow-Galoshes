## YELLOW GALOSHES

He spraypainted  
his yellow galoshes.  
Graffiti on rubber.

Mud on the trail  
and spiked lizards  
on the artwork.

Long trench coat  
heirloom of rainclouds  
stolen from Humphrey's closet.

Tilted was his Panama hat  
Collecting slim sun rays,  
rays indulging in escapism  
between gerontocratic branches.  
Rays, gasping for reflection.

He longed for some punkish woodpeckers  
penetrating the acoustic ambiance  
like that made by the god awful ambulance  
carrying away his heart.

The shack is a refuge  
and named him Dustman  
as he entered  
again barefoot.
